Consider the two-dimensional gaussian kernel G_σ(x), normalized to have integral 1
ChatGPT ha dit:

The two-dimensional Gaussian kernel with standard deviation σσ, normalized to have integral 1, is defined as:
Gσ(x,y)=12πσ2exp⁡(−x2+y22σ2)
Gσ​(x,y)=2πσ21​exp(−2σ2x2+y2​)

where (x,y)∈R2(x,y)∈R2, and the normalization constant 12πσ22πσ21​ ensures:
∬R2Gσ(x,y) dx dy=1
∬R2​Gσ​(x,y)dxdy=1
Heu dit:
This kernel acts over functions by convolution, let us denote it by G_σ f(x).  Assuming that f is regular enough, fix a point x, and compute the taylor polynomial of G_σf(x) around σ=0 (just the first two or three terms)
ChatGPT ha dit:

Let Gσf(x)=∫R2Gσ(y)f(x−y) dyGσ​f(x)=∫R2​Gσ​(y)f(x−y)dy. Assume f∈C∞f∈C∞, and fix x∈R2x∈R2. Expand f(x−y)f(x−y) via Taylor around xx:
f(x−y)=f(x)−∇f(x)⋅y+12yTHf(x)y+⋯
f(x−y)=f(x)−∇f(x)⋅y+21​yTHf(x)y+⋯

where ∇f(x)∈R2∇f(x)∈R2 is the gradient, and Hf(x)∈R2×2Hf(x)∈R2×2 is the Hessian.

Substitute into convolution:
Gσf(x)=∫R2Gσ(y)f(x−y) dy≈f(x)∫Gσ(y) dy−∇f(x)⋅∫yGσ(y) dy+12∫yTHf(x)y Gσ(y) dy
Gσ​f(x)=∫R2​Gσ​(y)f(x−y)dy≈f(x)∫Gσ​(y)dy−∇f(x)⋅∫yGσ​(y)dy+21​∫yTHf(x)yGσ​(y)dy

Evaluate each term:

    ∫Gσ(y) dy=1∫Gσ​(y)dy=1

    ∫yGσ(y) dy=0∫yGσ​(y)dy=0 (by symmetry)

    ∫yTHf(x)y Gσ(y) dy=tr(Hf(x)⋅Σ)∫yTHf(x)yGσ​(y)dy=tr(Hf(x)⋅Σ), with Σ=σ2IΣ=σ2I, so =σ2Δf(x)=σ2Δf(x)

Hence:
Gσf(x)=f(x)+σ22Δf(x)+o(σ2)
Gσ​f(x)=f(x)+2σ2​Δf(x)+o(σ2)

This is the Taylor expansion of Gσf(x)Gσ​f(x) around σ=0σ=0, up to second order.

Gσ1∗Gσ2=Gσ12+σ22
Gσ1​​∗Gσ2​​=Gσ12​+σ22​

for all σ1,σ2>0σ1​,σ2​>0, where ∗∗ denotes convolution.
Heu dit:
Do other one-parameter semigroups lead to similar taylor expansions (e.g. involving derivatives of f)
ChatGPT ha dit:

Yes. Any one-parameter convolution semigroup {Kt}t≥0{Kt​}t≥0​ of smoothing kernels, with Kt∗f→fKt​∗f→f as t→0t→0, yields a Taylor expansion:
Ktf(x)=f(x)+tAf(x)+o(t)
Kt​f(x)=f(x)+tAf(x)+o(t)

where AA is the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup. If the semigroup is isotropic and translation-invariant, AA is typically a differential operator. For the heat semigroup, A=12ΔA=21​Δ. For fractional diffusion, A=−(−Δ)α/2A=−(−Δ)α/2. Expansion structure persists across such semigroups.
Heu dit:
does the infinitessimal generator depend on the parametrization of the semigroup?  (e.g., if we use t=σ^2 we obtain a different expansion)
ChatGPT ha dit:

Yes. The infinitesimal generator depends on the parametrization of the semigroup. If KtKt​ is a semigroup with generator AA, and you reparametrize via t=ϕ(s)t=ϕ(s), where ϕϕ is smooth and strictly increasing with ϕ(0)=0ϕ(0)=0, then the generator in the new parameter ss becomes ϕ′(0)Aϕ′(0)A. Example: for the Gaussian kernel GσGσ​, the semigroup is naturally parametrized by t=σ2t=σ2, giving
Gσ2f(x)=f(x)+σ22Δf(x)+o(σ2)
Gσ2​f(x)=f(x)+2σ2​Δf(x)+o(σ2)

If instead you parametrize by σσ, then the expansion is
Gσf(x)=f(x)+12σ2Δf(x)+o(σ2)
Gσ​f(x)=f(x)+21​σ2Δf(x)+o(σ2)

The generator remains 12Δ21​Δ, but the leading coefficient depends on the derivative of the parametrization at zero.

Heu dit:
are the fractional heat semigroup and the poisson semigroup related?
ChatGPT ha dit:

Yes. The Poisson semigroup is the subordination of the fractional heat semigroup with exponent α=1α=1. More precisely:

Let Tt=e−t(−Δ)α/2Tt​=e−t(−Δ)α/2 be the fractional heat semigroup. The Poisson semigroup Pt=e−t−ΔPt​=e−t−Δ

​ corresponds to the case α=1α=1. By the Bochner subordination formula:
e−t−Δ=∫0∞t2πs3e−t2/4se−s(−Δ) ds
e−t−Δ
​=∫0∞​2πs3
​t​e−t2/4se−s(−Δ)ds

This expresses the Poisson semigroup as an integral (subordination) over the classical heat semigroup. In general, for 0<α<20<α<2, the semigroup e−t(−Δ)α/2e−t(−Δ)α/2 is subordinated to the heat semigroup via a stable subordinator.
Heu dit:
Consider the Fourier multiplier R_s(y)=1/|y|^s (defined in the frequency domain, maybe with an appropriate normalizing constant), acting upon functions of zero mean.  Does it define a semigroup?
ChatGPT ha dit:

No. The operator defined by the Fourier multiplier Rs(y)=1∣y∣sRs​(y)=∣y∣s1​, even with normalization, does not define a semigroup in the parameter ss.

Reason: The semigroup property requires
Rs1∘Rs2=Rs1+s2
Rs1​​∘Rs2​​=Rs1​+s2​​

This fails for RsRs​. Composition of Fourier multipliers corresponds to pointwise multiplication of their symbols:
Rs1f^(ξ)=1∣ξ∣s1f^(ξ),Rs2f^(ξ)=1∣ξ∣s2f^(ξ)⇒Rs1∘Rs2⇒1∣ξ∣s1+s2
Rs1​​f
​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s1​1​f^​(ξ),Rs2​​f
​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s2​1​f^​(ξ)⇒Rs1​​∘Rs2​​⇒∣ξ∣s1​+s2​1​

But this only mimics the behavior of a semigroup if RsRs​ is defined as a family of fractional integrals or fractional powers of a fixed operator, not arbitrary multipliers. However, fractional powers of the Laplacian satisfy this structure:
(−Δ)−s/2∘(−Δ)−t/2=(−Δ)−(s+t)/2
(−Δ)−s/2∘(−Δ)−t/2=(−Δ)−(s+t)/2

So, defining Rs=(−Δ)−s/2Rs​=(−Δ)−s/2 does yield a semigroup. But Rs(ξ)=1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s1​ on its own, without being linked to a semigroup structure via operator calculus (e.g. functional calculus), does not define a semigroup unless further structural constraints are imposed.
Heu dit:
what are these structural constraints
ChatGPT ha dit:

To make Rs(ξ)=1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s1​ define a semigroup in ss, structural constraints must align it with fractional powers of a positive self-adjoint operator under functional calculus. These constraints are:

    Operator Origin:
    RsRs​ must be interpretable as Rs=A−s/2Rs​=A−s/2, where AA is a densely defined, positive, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. Example: A=−ΔA=−Δ on L2(Rn)L2(Rn), with domain including functions of zero mean (to avoid singularity at ξ=0ξ=0).

    Spectral Calculus Compatibility:
    The family {Rs}s>0{Rs​}s>0​ must be generated via spectral calculus applied to AA, i.e.,
    Rsf=∫0∞λ−s/2 dEλf
    Rs​f=∫0∞​λ−s/2dEλ​f

    where {Eλ}{Eλ​} is the spectral resolution of AA.

    Normalization and Domain:
    The Fourier multiplier 1∣ξ∣s∣ξ∣s1​ must act on tempered distributions or L2L2 functions with zero mean, so that singularity at ξ=0ξ=0 is avoided. This domain restriction is essential for defining RsRs​ as a continuous operator.

    Semigroup Law via Functional Calculus:
    Once Rs=A−s/2Rs​=A−s/2, the semigroup law holds:
    Rs1∘Rs2=A−(s1+s2)/2=Rs1+s2
    Rs1​​∘Rs2​​=A−(s1​+s2​)/2=Rs1​+s2​​

    Thus, s↦Rss↦Rs​ becomes a strongly continuous commutative semigroup on the range of AA.

    Exclusion of Zero Eigenvalue:
    For operators like −Δ−Δ, zero eigenvalue leads to divergence in ∣ξ∣−s∣ξ∣−s near ξ=0ξ=0. Solutions: restrict to zero-mean functions, or modify operator (e.g., work on torus with projection).

Only under these constraints does RsRs​ represent a semigroup consistent with the theory of fractional integration or diffusion. Without them, RsRs​ is just a singular Fourier multiplier family lacking semigroup structure.
Heu dit:
Ok, let us add these constraints and denote the resulting semigroup as R_s.  What are reasonable choices of the normalization constant?
ChatGPT ha dit:

To make Rs(ξ)=1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s1​ a well-defined semigroup, we need to carefully choose a normalization constant that ensures both the operator is bounded and the semigroup property holds. The key constraints we’re working with are:

    Domain: The operator should act on functions of zero mean to avoid divergence at ξ=0ξ=0.

    Normalization: The normalization constant should ensure that RsRs​ is a bounded operator on the appropriate function space (such as L2(Rn)L2(Rn)) and that the semigroup property holds.

Reasonable Choices for Normalization Constant
1. Normalization for L2L2 Space (and avoiding singularity at ξ=0ξ=0):

For Rs(ξ)=1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s1​ to act as a Fourier multiplier on functions in L2(Rn)L2(Rn) with zero mean, we must ensure that the operator is bounded. The most common choice of normalization is:
Rs(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣s
Rs​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣s1​

where CnCn​ is a constant that depends on the dimension nn. The exact form of CnCn​ can be determined by considering the scaling properties of the Fourier transform and the space on which RsRs​ acts. For the operator to be consistent with the fractional power of −Δ−Δ (which is the operator generating the semigroup), CnCn​ must be chosen such that:
Rsis a bounded operator onL2(Rn)
Rs​is a bounded operator onL2(Rn)

The scaling behavior of the Fourier transform and the requirement for the semigroup law Rs1∘Rs2=Rs1+s2Rs1​​∘Rs2​​=Rs1​+s2​​ generally leads to the following normalization in nn-dimensional space:
Cn=(2π)n/2Γ(n2−s/2)
Cn​=Γ(2n​−s/2)(2π)n/2​

This ensures that Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ) is correctly scaled to satisfy the properties of a fractional integral and ensures the semigroup property holds.
2. Alternative Normalization: 1∣ξ∣s∣ξ∣s1​ on TnTn:

If the operator is defined on the torus TnTn, the Fourier transform becomes periodic, and the normalization constant changes to adapt to the compact domain. For the torus case, the Fourier series would yield a simpler normalization, typically involving the volume of the torus ∣Tn∣∣Tn∣, which is the constant 11 in TnTn.
3. Additional Constraints on CnCn​:

The constant CnCn​ can also be determined by considering the behavior of the semigroup in L2(Rn)L2(Rn), and ensuring that the norm of RsRs​ is bounded as ss varies. It is often chosen such that the following holds:

    For RsRs​ to be a bounded operator, CnCn​ is related to the scaling of the fractional power operator (−Δ)−s/2(−Δ)−s/2.

    If we want RsRs​ to be consistent with a specific known fractional operator, such as (−Δ)−s/2(−Δ)−s/2, the choice of CnCn​ will align with the spectral properties of the Laplacian, ensuring the operator behaves in a way that conforms with the standard fractional calculus.

Final Form of Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ):

Given the above normalization, a reasonable form for Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ) is:
Rs(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣s
Rs​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣s1​

where CnCn​ is typically of the form (2π)n/2Γ(n2−s/2)Γ(2n​−s/2)(2π)n/2​ for RnRn and adapted based on the domain (e.g., for the torus).

This ensures that RsRs​ behaves as a Fourier multiplier with the desired properties, is bounded, and defines a valid semigroup.
Heu dit:
let us forget the tours and stay in R^n.  Consider the final form of R_s(ξ) that you have written above.  What is the behavoir as s approaches 0, 1, 2, -1 and -2
ChatGPT ha dit:

Let's analyze the behavior of the Fourier multiplier Rs(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣s1​ in RnRn as ss approaches specific values: 0, 1, 2, -1, and -2. We'll also keep in mind the normalization constant Cn=(2π)n/2Γ(n2−s/2)Cn​=Γ(2n​−s/2)(2π)n/2​, which helps ensure that RsRs​ is a well-defined operator in L2(Rn)L2(Rn).
1. As s→0s→0:

As s→0s→0, the multiplier Rs(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣s1​ approaches:
R0(ξ)=Cn⋅1
R0​(ξ)=Cn​⋅1

This means that for s→0s→0, Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ) converges to the identity operator, because the Fourier multiplier becomes constant (it behaves like the identity operator in the frequency domain). Since the normalization constant CnCn​ is finite, we have:
R0(ξ)→constant
R0​(ξ)→constant

This is the behavior of the operator as ss approaches 0.
2. As s→1s→1:

As s→1s→1, the multiplier 1∣ξ∣s∣ξ∣s1​ behaves like:
R1(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣
R1​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣1​

For s=1s=1, the Fourier multiplier corresponds to the fractional integral of order 1, which is related to the Riesz potential. The operator R1R1​ becomes singular at ξ=0ξ=0, as 1∣ξ∣∣ξ∣1​ diverges when ξ→0ξ→0. This suggests that for s=1s=1, the multiplier operator is borderline in terms of regularity and can be understood as a principal value operator.
3. As s→2s→2:

For s=2s=2, the multiplier becomes:
R2(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣2
R2​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣21​

This is related to the inverse Laplacian in the frequency domain, corresponding to the Green's function of the Laplacian. The operator R2R2​ behaves similarly to the fractional integral of order 2, and it is closely related to the potential operator for the Laplacian. As s→2s→2, the normalization constant CnCn​ ensures that R2R2​ remains a well-defined operator on L2(Rn)L2(Rn).
4. As s→−1s→−1:

For s=−1s=−1, the multiplier becomes:
R−1(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣−1=Cn∣ξ∣
R−1​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣−11​=Cn​∣ξ∣

This is the Fourier multiplier corresponding to the differential operator ∇∇ (since multiplication by ∣ξ∣∣ξ∣ corresponds to differentiation in the frequency domain). In this case, R−1R−1​ represents a derivative in physical space. The operator R−1R−1​ is no longer smoothing and corresponds to taking the first derivative of a function. The normalization constant CnCn​ ensures that the operator is properly scaled in the frequency domain.
5. As s→−2s→−2:

For s=−2s=−2, the multiplier becomes:
R−2(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣−2=Cn∣ξ∣2
R−2​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣−21​=Cn​∣ξ∣2

This corresponds to the Laplacian operator in the frequency domain, since multiplication by ∣ξ∣2∣ξ∣2 is associated with the second derivative in physical space. As s→−2s→−2, the multiplier R−2(ξ)R−2​(ξ) becomes the standard Laplacian in the Fourier domain. The operator R−2R−2​ thus represents the second derivative operator in physical space, and the normalization constant CnCn​ ensures that the operator is scaled properly for the L2L2 space.
Summary of the Behavior:

    As s→0s→0: R0(ξ)→identityR0​(ξ)→identity, corresponding to no operation in the frequency domain.

    As s→1s→1: R1(ξ)=Cn∣ξ∣R1​(ξ)=∣ξ∣Cn​​, corresponding to a Riesz potential, a borderline singular operator.

    As s→2s→2: R2(ξ)=Cn∣ξ∣2R2​(ξ)=∣ξ∣2Cn​​, corresponding to the inverse Laplacian operator.

    As s→−1s→−1: R−1(ξ)=Cn∣ξ∣R−1​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣, corresponding to the derivative operator (in the frequency domain).

    As s→−2s→−2: R−2(ξ)=Cn∣ξ∣2R−2​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣2, corresponding to the Laplacian operator (in the frequency domain).

Heu dit:
does this semigroup have a name?
ChatGPT ha dit:

Yes, the semigroup {Rs}s≥0{Rs​}s≥0​, where Rs(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣s1​, is closely related to the Riesz potential semigroup (or Riesz fractional integral semigroup) when it acts on suitable function spaces, particularly in RnRn.

More specifically:

    For s>0s>0, the operators Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ) are related to fractional integration operators, which are used in fractional calculus and potential theory. These are often referred to as Riesz potentials or fractional integrals of order ss.

    For s<0s<0, the operators Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ) correspond to fractional derivatives or fractional powers of the Laplacian.

Therefore, when taken as a semigroup, this family of operators is typically called the Riesz potential semigroup or the semigroup of fractional powers of the Laplacian.
Key Details:

    For s>0s>0: The operator RsRs​ acts like a fractional integral, smoothing functions.

    For s<0s<0: The operator RsRs​ acts like a fractional derivative, differentiating functions.

This semigroup has applications in various areas such as fractional diffusion equations, potential theory, and harmonic analysis, where such fractional powers of the Laplacian are commonly used.

Thus, the semigroup {Rs}s≥0{Rs​}s≥0​ could be referred to as the Riesz fractional potential semigroup or fractional power semigroup of the Laplacian, depending on the context.
Heu dit:
does this semigroup admit an infinitessimal generator?
ChatGPT ha dit:

Yes, the semigroup {Rs}s≥0{Rs​}s≥0​, defined by Rs(ξ)=Cn1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=Cn​∣ξ∣s1​ in the frequency domain, does admit an infinitesimal generator, provided the appropriate functional framework is chosen. This semigroup is related to fractional powers of the Laplacian, so its infinitesimal generator is closely linked to the Laplacian operator.
Infinitesimal Generator of the Semigroup:

The infinitesimal generator AA of the semigroup {Rs}s≥0{Rs​}s≥0​ can be derived from the fact that Rs(ξ)Rs​(ξ) is essentially a Fourier multiplier, and the corresponding semigroup is related to fractional powers of the Laplacian operator.

For Rs=(−Δ)−s/2Rs​=(−Δ)−s/2 (in the case of the Laplacian ΔΔ), the semigroup RsRs​ corresponds to the operator (−Δ)−s/2(−Δ)−s/2, which is a fractional power of the Laplacian.

The infinitesimal generator AA of this semigroup is the operator associated with the derivative of RsRs​ with respect to ss at s=0s=0. This is given by:
A=ddsRs∣s=0=lim⁡s→0Rs−Is
A=dsd​Rs​
​s=0​=s→0lim​sRs​−I​

Since RsRs​ corresponds to fractional powers of the Laplacian, the generator can be computed as:
A=−12Δ
A=−21​Δ

Thus, the infinitesimal generator AA of the semigroup {Rs}s≥0{Rs​}s≥0​ is the Laplacian operator ΔΔ (with a factor −12−21​ for proper normalization, corresponding to the fractional powers).
Explanation:

    The semigroup RsRs​ is closely related to the fractional powers of the Laplacian. Specifically, Rs(ξ)=1∣ξ∣sRs​(ξ)=∣ξ∣s1​ corresponds to (−Δ)−s/2(−Δ)−s/2, which is a well-defined operator for s>0s>0.

    The infinitesimal generator of a semigroup is typically the operator AA such that Rs=esARs​=esA for small ss. In this case, the generator AA corresponds to the Laplacian ΔΔ, which generates the fractional powers of the Laplacian.

Thus, the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup {Rs}{Rs​} is A=−12ΔA=−21​Δ, where ΔΔ is the Laplacian operator. This is consistent with the fact that the semigroup {Rs}s≥0{Rs​}s≥0​ is related to the heat semigroup generated by the Laplacian, but with fractional powers instead of integer powers.

How These References Relate to the Semigroup:

    Fractional Calculus in Image Processing: Many of the references discuss the application of fractional integrals and derivatives in image processing, which directly connects to the fractional powers of the Laplacian (semigroup) you’ve been studying. Fractional derivatives, in particular, enhance edges and fine details, making them useful for tasks like edge detection, denoising, and image enhancement.

    Retinex Theory: Although Retinex theory is primarily focused on color constancy and illumination correction, it involves local contrast enhancement, which is analogous to the edge-preserving smoothing and gradient-based operations that the fractional Laplacian semigroup {Rs}{Rs​} can perform.

    Multiscale Image Processing: The fractional power semigroup plays a significant role in multiscale representations of images, where it acts as a low-pass filter for large scales and a high-pass filter for small scales, thereby providing an effective way of enhancing image features at multiple levels.

By consulting these references, you will find both theoretical insights and practical applications related to the use of fractional powers of the Laplacian and Fourier multipliers in image processing, particularly in the areas of edge detection, contrast enhancement, and image smoothing.
